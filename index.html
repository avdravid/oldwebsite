                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p> Hi! My name is Amil Dravid, and I am a second year computer science and statistics student at Northwestern University. I am a member of the Northwestern Image and Video Processing Lab (<a href="https://ivpl.northwestern.edu/">IVPL</a>)
			under Professor Aggelos Katsaggelos.
			Although I am just
			beginning my journey in the academic world, I have huge aspirations. I will strive to earn
			a PhD in computer science (CS) and become a tenured professor at a research-intensive university, balancing research, teaching, advising, 
			while leading an AI lab. I also intend to involve myself in industry by collaborating with companies or perhaps even starting my own! </p>
			
			<br>
			<p> Many factors have influenced my goals.  My parents want me to be aware of the conditions around the world, so I have spent entire summers of my childhood in my grandparents’ one bedroom apartment. 
				I observed the desperation of children on the streets as they huddled around in search of coins. My parents both transcended the limited means of their Indian villages to obtain a world class education in the US, 
				like millions of first-generation immigrants. This inspires me to make my own opportunities.  <p>
				
				<br>
			<p>
			I am also inspired by my dad, Vinayak Dravid a successful materials science professor at Northwestern. 
			As a young boy, I would itch to visit his lab, where he gave me articles to peruse and liquid nitrogen to shatter tennis balls or 
			make "ice cream." I would proudly look forward to class trips where he volunteered to show his lab around. 
			These academic and global influences have helped me develop the initiative to pursue my own research endeavors with human applications in mind.<p>
			<br>
			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<h3> Technical </h3>
			<p>My previous work has explored applications of machine learning. This includes graph-CNN based Alzheimer’s detection,
			extracting nanoscopic cancer features from cell micrographs via deep learning methods, and COVID screening from lung X-rays,
			all of which have been published or are in-press. To make a fundamental impact in computing research, I want to research at the foundational
			level to develop novel architectures that can be trained and deployed to benefit the research community and society.<p>
