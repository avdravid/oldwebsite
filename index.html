                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p> Hi! My name is Amil Dravid, and I am a second year computer science and statistics student at Northwestern University. Although I am just
			beginning my journey in the academic world, I have huge aspirations. I will strive to ear
			a PhD in computer science (CS) and become a tenured professor at a research-intensive university, balancing research, teaching, advising, 
			while leading an AI lab. I also intend to involve myself in industry by collaborating with companies or perhaps even starting my own! </p>
			
			<br>
			<p> As a young boy, I would itch to visit my dadâ€™s lab, where he gave me articles to peruse and liquid nitrogen to play with by shattering tennis balls or 
				making ice cream. I would proudly look forward to class trips where he volunteered to show his lab around. 
				These academic and global influences have helped me develop the initiative to pursue my own research endeavors with human applications in mind.<p>
